This code currently uses ROS2 Jazzy for a small differential drive robot modeled after many found on the internet. Much guidance was learned from Udemy courses (instructors: A. Brandi, E. Renard, R. Andrade, & others), ArticulatedRobots videos (J. Newans), and of course the tutorials provided by ROS2, Gazebo, SLAM, MoveIt2, and others.

This robot uses 
- two Arduino Nano 33 micros, one for each DC motor.
- one RPi4 using Ubuntu 24.04 & ROS2 Jazzy for robot description, drive, and arm manipulation
- one RPi5 using Ubuntu 24.04 & ROS2 Jazzy for SLAM

As of 2/1/2025, code is lacking
- navigation
- automation
- image recognition
- multiple manipulators
